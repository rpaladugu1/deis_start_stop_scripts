For this to work, the Deis environment should be up and running.\r\n\r\nTo run the scripts: \r\n\r\nOne time setup: \r\n`chmod 744 deis_start.sh deis_stop.sh deis_env.sh `\r\n\r\nTo actually run them (will be run in your current session): \r\n`. ./deis_start.sh`\r\n\r\nNote: Just drop these scripts in to your deis folder to get started. \r\n\r\n","google":"","note":"Don't delete this file!
